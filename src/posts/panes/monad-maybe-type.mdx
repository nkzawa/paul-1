Without the `{ value }` wrapper, we can't infer the type of `undefined`. `undefined` could be `Maybe<T>` or `Maybe<Maybe<T>>` or `Maybe<Maybe<Maybe<T>>>` and so on.

Equivalently, we would not be able to express the equivalent of the following value.

```tsx
{ value: undefined }: Maybe<Maybe<T>>
```

In normal TypeScript code, the idea of `Maybe` is represented as `T | undefined`.
