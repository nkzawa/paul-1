Without the `{ value }` wrapper, we can't infer the type of `undefined`. `undefined` could be `Maybe<T>` or `Maybe<Maybe<T>>` or `Maybe<Maybe<Maybe<T>>>` and so on.

Equivalently, we would not be able to express the equivalent of the following value.

```tsx
{ value: undefined }: Maybe<Maybe<T>>
```

In most TypeScript code, the idea of `Maybe` is represented as `T | undefined`.

```tsx
function parseStringToColor(input: string): Color | undefined {
  switch (input) {
    case 'red':
      return Color.Red;
    case 'green':
      return Color.Green;
    case 'blue':
      return Color.Blue;
    default:
      return undefined;
  }
} 
```
