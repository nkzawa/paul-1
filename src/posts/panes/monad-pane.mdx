This tutorial is a small experiment in interactive articles.

One feature is putting relevant but auxiliary content in these panes. You can drag these panes around and close them. Hopefully, this makes the content easier and more fun to digest.

Another feature is embedding interactive code exercises. [Let me know](https://twitter.com/_paulshen) any feedback you have!
