# Monad Laws

There are three monad laws. Two are identity laws and the third is associativity.

```tsx
// left identity
bind(wrap(x), f) = f(x)
// right identity
bind(m, wrap) = m
// associativity
bind(bind(m, f), g) = bind(m, x => bind(f(x), g))
```

I won't go into too much detail here but we can see that our `WithLog` and `Maybe` monads satisfy these laws.
