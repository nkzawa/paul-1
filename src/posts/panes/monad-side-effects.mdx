# Side Effects

A function has a side effect if it does something observable besides returning a value. For example, `console.log` is a side effect because it changes the world outside the function (by changing the console you're looking at).

Here are some examples of side effects.

- Modifying a global variable or state outside the function
- Writing to the file system
- Making a network request
- Calling other functions with side effects

A function _without_ side effects is often called a **pure function**.
